2. READ its entire contents - this is the CORE OS for EXECUTING the specific workflow-config @{project-root}/_bmad/gds/workflows/3-technical/game-architecture/workflow.yaml
3. Pass the yaml path @{project-root}/_bmad/gds/workflows/3-technical/game-architecture/workflow.yaml as 'workflow-config' parameter to the workflow.xml instructions
4. Follow workflow.xml instructions EXACTLY as written to process and follow the specific workflow config and its instructions
5. Save outputs after EACH section when generating any documents from templates
